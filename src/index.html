                    <h1>Technology strategy for growing businesses</h1>

                    <p>Kittredge Technologies specializes in helping Maine-based start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses navigate technology-driven transformation - particularly when resources are limited. Whether it's capital constraints, labor scarcity, or both, we help companies achieve ambitious technology goals with what they have.</p>

                    <p>Fletcher brings over 30 years of experience in technology leadership, having founded and led GWI (Biddeford Internet Corporation) through five major business model transformations. His unique expertise lies in managing technology transformations with scarce resources - equivalent to executing five bootstrap start-ups in series.</p>

                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p>Fletcher Kittredge has spent his career building and transforming technology companies - and now helps others do the same.</p>

                        <p>From 1994 to 2025, Fletcher founded and led GWI (Biddeford Internet Corporation), growing it into Maine's largest internet service provider. Over three decades, he navigated the company through five complete business model transformations - from dial-up startup to statewide broadband provider to fiber infrastructure builder. Each pivot required rethinking strategy, technology, and operations with constrained resources. That experience - essentially five bootstrap startups executed in series - now informs his advisory work.</p>

                        <p>Before GWI, Fletcher spent nine years at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), the research firm that helped build the original internet. He joined the team shortly after the first deployment of Internet Protocols to ARPAnet - the foundation of the modern internet.</p>
