## This is an Example Post

This post demonstrates how the insights system works. When you create your own posts:

1. Copy the frontmatter format from TEMPLATE.md
2. Write your content in Markdown
3. Save the file with a descriptive name like `2025-01-20-your-topic.md`
4. The post will automatically appear on the homepage

## Frontmatter Fields

- **title**: The main title of your post
- **description**: SEO description (150-160 characters ideal)
- **date**: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **summary**: One-sentence teaser for the homepage
- **permalink**: URL path for this post

## Writing Tips

Use headers (##, ###) to organize your content. The system will automatically:

- Style all your headings with the brand colors
- Add reading time estimates
- Create a clean, readable layout
- Include navigation back to the homepage

Delete this file and create your own insights posts!
