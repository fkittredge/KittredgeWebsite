Fletcher's background is as a founder and CEO of a high-tech company, GWI. Over 30 years, Fletcher led GWI through multiple transformations and helped other companies with transformations. The website should be clean, professional, and focused.

## Project Goals

- Create a simple, professional website
- Showcase Fletcher Kittredge's experience and expertise
- Provide clear contact information for potential clients
- Maintain a clean, easy-to-navigate design

### Experience
***IMPORTANT***: Summarize experience

From 1984 to 1993 I worked at [Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTX_BBN_Technologies) in Cambridge, MA. I started working on the team that developed the first deployment of the Internet Protocols(IPv4), the orginal Internet. The first rollout of IP to the ARPAnet was in 1983, the year before I joined BBN. My first position was Source Code Analyst, but I immediately became a system adminstrator for the department's Unix system since they didn't have one and I had learned how to be a SysAdmin at Colby. The next year, my job included programming in C. I did that until 1988, when I transfered to the Software Products division.
In 1993 I left BBN to become a consultant to Fidelity Investments. My area of expertise was distributed object oriented systems. With the growing popularity of the Internet, it quickly became building early interactive webpages.
In 1994, I founded Biddeford Internet Corporation (d/b/a GWI) and led the company for  at the time we were the only local Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the State of Maine. We primarily provided dial-up Internet access, but also provided every other type of Internet service at the time: domain, website, email hosting, website development, high speed lines to businesses.

***IMPORTANT*** I led GWI for 30 years. During that time we underwent five transformations in business model. The transformations were driven by advances of technology. In each case, because we were capital constrained, we needed to make the transformations with existing resources. It was equivalent to doing five bootstrap start-ups in series.
